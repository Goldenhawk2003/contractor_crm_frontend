<section id="transfer">
    <h2>Transferring Your Personal Information</h2>
    <p>To operate effectively, we may transfer Personal Information to our subsidiaries or affiliates, contractors, service providers, and other third parties that support our business operations. These entities are contractually obligated to handle Personal Information securely and in compliance with the standards set forth in this Policy.
 
Personal Information may be processed, stored, or transferred outside of Canada, including in jurisdictions where privacy laws may differ from those in Canada. For example, certain technology services supporting our Website, including cloud hosting providers and payment processors, may be located in the United States. In such cases, the governments, courts, law enforcement, or regulatory agencies of that country may be able to obtain access to your Personal Information under the laws of the foreign jurisdiction.
 
We take appropriate steps to ensure that all third-party entities handling Personal Information outside of Canada adhere to strict security and privacy safeguards in accordance with this Policy and applicable Canadian privacy legislation.
 
You are welcome to contact us to obtain further information about our practices regarding service providers located outside of Canada. See Section 17 for details.
 
By submitting your Personal Information or engaging with the Website, you consent to such transfer, storage, and processing of your information outside of Canada.

<section id="security">
    <h2>Security of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>The security of your Personal Information is very important to us. We use physical, electronic, and administrative measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. We employ industry-standard data protection measures and tools, including:
<br/>●  	Data Protection and Encryption: Personal Information is securely managed within ETN’s cloud-based infrastructure, hosted on Heroku and supported by Google Cloud services. All data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, with restricted access controls in place to prevent unauthorized access or breaches.
<br/>●  	Access Controls and Authentication: ETN applies access control principles to limit data access to authorized personnel only. User authentication is handled through secure token-based mechanisms utilizing the Django REST framework, providing validation and protection against unauthorized access.
<br/>●  	Network and System Security: Our systems are protected by standard firewall measures and platform-level security provided by Heroku’s managed environment. Real-time monitoring tools are in place to help detect unusual activity or threats.
<br/>●  	Security Monitoring & Incident Response: We monitor system activities to detect potential security incidents and unauthorized access attempts. In the event of a security incident, ETN follows an internal incident response process that includes investigation, remediation, and, where appropriate, notification to affected individuals and authorities. Our security measures are regularly reviewed and updated to align with evolving best practices. As we scale, we remain committed to enhancing our security measures to align with industry best practices.
While we employ robust security measures to safeguard your Personal Information, no system is entirely immune to risks. The safety and security of your information also depend on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website like message boards, which any Website visitor can view.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a data breach that poses a significant risk of harm, ETN will notify affected users as required by applicable laws.

<section id="retention">
    <h2>Retention Of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulation, we will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to provide our Services and fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
 
For users who create accounts on our platform, we retain Personal Information for the duration of the account’s active status and for a reasonable period thereafter, in accordance with our data retention policies and applicable laws. For Guest Users who interact with the platform without creating an account, Personal Information is typically retained for approximately seventy-two (72) hours before being either converted into a lead or securely deleted if not actioned.
 
Where Personal Information is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected, we securely destroy, erase, or anonymize the data in compliance with applicable legal obligations. We may use anonymized or de-identified information for legitimate business purposes, such as analytics, research, and platform improvement initiatives, without further notice to you or your consent.
